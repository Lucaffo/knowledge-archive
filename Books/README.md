# Books
Contains sketch, information, exercises about the singolar books. Materials can vary between texts and only exercises based on my personal experience. 

**ALERT**
This materials should be seen as <b>*sketches*</b> and <b>*not completed*</b> works. I almost everytime write in english, but it's not impossible to find materials in _italian_.
