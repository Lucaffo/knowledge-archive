Game Project stages
-------------------

When you write a game, there is a well written steps to follow in order to deploy a good game. As in normal programming, game programming is a subsection of it, and the creation process doesn't change too much, it's not an exception.

A game project have differents stages to pass in order to be released:

-   Pre-production ( This is the stage where the game is designed, defined its basic shape and scopes )
-   Production Alpha ( This is the stage where the programmer design/develop systems, complete the game but without any assets or at least not the all the assets that should be involved)
-   Production Beta ( This is the stage where the game implements all the assets and fix bug that can pop up during the stage )
-   Post production ( The game is released, but under mantainence because some bugs can pop up after the release )
-   Marketing part ( This stage during from production, can engage the fans and create hype, boosting the releasing success and selling. Marketing and social media are used even to communicate with users about bug fixing, server problems or events like canonical festival or sales)

What is a videogame
===
In short, _a [videogame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game) is an electronic game_, they use peripherals like keyboard or controller (or both) to allow interaction between the player and the game itself (User). A game must be efficient as possible, and use all the hardware resources in an optimal way. _A game must be an experience, a good one if it's possibile, where the player is absorbed by the mechanics or what the game wants to tell to the player._

What's the difference between a game and other media like film?
---------------------------------------------------------------

_A game aim to be a good **interaction experience**._ You can interact with the game and change it's behaviour, you can't with a film. The story it can be well written in each of them, but the standing point is _"You can't interact with a film, you can't change it"._
